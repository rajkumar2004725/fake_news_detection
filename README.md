Fake News Detection Using NLP üì∞üîç


**Overview**
This project aims to classify news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We employ TF-IDF and Word2Vec for feature extraction and use Logistic Regression and Random Forest for classification.

**Dataset**
We use the Fake and Real News Dataset from Kaggle:

    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

**Features:**

    Text Preprocessing (stopword removal, stemming, punctuation removal)
    
    TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction
    
    Word2Vec Embeddings for deep text representation
    
    Classification Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest,etc)

    Feature Visualization (t-SNE & PCA)


**Clone the repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/rajkumar2004725/fake_news_detection.git  
    cd fake_news_detection  
  
**Future Work**

    Implement BERT embeddings for better accuracy
    
    Optimize hyperparameters for model improvement
    
    Deploy as a web application
